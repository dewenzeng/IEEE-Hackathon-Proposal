 The covid-19 dataset we are using: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VtGxNAuox75jVOncH36ozp1LCyZa4fje
 
 The code to process the covid-19 dataset can be found in this repo: https://github.com/lzx325/COVID-19-repo
 
 The pretrained model cooresponds to the code can be found in: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_-W8HcHpnBS_9Hkz6P5QfE6Gw-pNXxZ7

# How to use our code

1. Download the preprocessing data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g2YDMp4wCALeQLBXi-NsY6eW_wExfHO-?usp=sharing) and the pretrained model from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ASbqSiKx7d1m1nvSW6h0dba_HlIXA_oq?usp=sharing).
2. Change the path test_data_dir, model_infection_dir and model_lung_dir in prediction.py according to your local path.
3. Run python prediction.py
